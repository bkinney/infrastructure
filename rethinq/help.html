   <li>Formative Assessment
     <ul>
       <li>A formative assessment is used to improve  by providing feedback during the learning process. Formative assessment is delivered early in the learning process, so that corrective action may be taken as needed. In contrast, a summative assessment is used to assess final learning outcomes, typically at the end of a course or unit of instruction.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  
  
  <li>Group Sets
    <ul>
      <li>A Canvas group set contains several sub-groups, and will only permit any given student from joining a single group within the set. This is especially valuable in conjunction with collaborative assignments.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  
    <li>People Tool
      <ul>
        <li>The Canvas People tool is used to display and administer course rosters and groups. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  

  <li>  </li>
    <li>Student View
      <ul>
      <li>When a student enters a reThinQ assignment, he should see a list of all students in his sub-group of the selected Group Set. Each team is required to de-select absent members, and select any unassigned members that have joined their group during class before entering the quiz.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
    <li>Instructor View
      <ul>
        <li>When an instructor visits an assignment associated with reThinQ, a quiz preview is shown. Use the Edit button in the right-hand panel to re-select a quiz or group set.</li>
       
        </ul>
    </li>
     <li>External Tool
(aka App)
  <ul>
        <li>An application hosted outside of Canvas that conforms to the IMS LTI standard for interoperability. External Tools are installed by visiting the Apps tab within course Settings.</li>
       
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Logging out
          <ul>
        <li>Logging out of a reThinQ session is required when group memberships change. It is also recommended that you log out of reThinQ before before switching to another UD LTI tool, such as Post'Em, Critboard, or Peer Evaluation.</li>
       
        </ul>
    </li>
        <li>Canvas Student View
  <ul>
        <li>While in Canvas' built-in Student View, you will be able to act as a student who has not been assigned to any group within the selected Group set. Be careful not to select other unassigned students before clicking begin. Doing so will immediately cause gradebook entries for each selected student, even before you answer any quiz questions. This may cause students to receive alarming email notifications.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
        <li>Immediate Feedback
          <ul>
            <li>Studies suggest that feedback is most effective when it is provided as sooner, rather than later. reThinQ feedback is presented on a question-by-question, answer-by-answer basis, providing instantaneous feedback, and an opportunity to, well, rethink.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Specific Feedback
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://rer.sagepub.com/content/77/1/81" title="The Power of Feedback" target="_blank" class="showme">Research</a> suggests that providing detailed, answer-specific feedback leads to better learning than generalized feedback, such as &quot;good job&quot; or &quot;try again&quot;. reThinQ quiz authors are encouraged to compose useful feedback for each incorrect response. The success of a reThinQ experience depends heavily on the quality of both questions and feedback.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div></div>
<div id="main">
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>A reThinQ exercise turns a Canvas multiple-choice quiz into an in-class assignment in which groups of students compete to achieve the highest score. Each time a team selects an answer, they are provided with <a href="http://www.edutopia.org/blog/tips-providing-students-meaningful-feedback-marianne-stenger" title="Tips on Providing Meaningful Feedback" target="_blank">immediate feedback</a>, and the chance to try again. Team scores reflect the number of incorrect answers selected. The pedagogy behind these types of activities is similar to <a href="http://cei.umn.edu/support-services/what-active-learning/basic-active-learning-strategies#think" title="Basic Active Learning Strategies" target="_blank">Think/Pair/Share</a>. It invites students to discuss difficult concepts and reach a consensus, then immediately learn whether their conclusions are sound. Quiz authors can enhance the experience further by providing answer-specific feedback to guide the follow-up discussion for particular distractors (incorrect responses). </p>
<p>reThinQ for Canvas@UD is designed to be used in conjunction with a Canvas Assignment, Group Set and Quiz. </p>
<p>When no Group Set is specified, reThinQ will deliver a conventional self-test with immediate feedback. Scores produced by reThinQ will appear as grades submitted for the Assignment, not the Quiz.</p>
<h3>How to Use this Page</h3>
<p>The glossary on the left should help you understand what the features of the tool are, and how these are
intended to be used. Step-by-Step instructions for setting up and using reThinQ as well as an FAQ can be located in the accordion panels below. Click on a panel's title to expand it. </p>

<div id="acc">
<h3>Step-by-Step</h3>
<div class="faq">
<ul class="close-others">
<li>Installing reThinQ
  <ol>
  <li>Launch Canvas, and browse to the course in which you wish to use reThinQ</li>
  <li>Click the Settings link located at the bottom of the Canvas navigation menu, located at the left side of the screen.</li>
  <li>Click on the Apps tab.</li>
  <li>Click the reThinQ button, and take careful note of the key and secret, located at the bottom of the App description text.</li>
  <li>Click the blue Add Tool button.</li>
  <li>In the window that pops up, enter the key and secret.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Create a Group Set
 <ol>
  <li>In the Canvas navigation menu, click the People link. </li>
  <li>Click the Blue + Group Set button.</li>
  <li>Name your Group Set.</li>
  <li>Use any method desired to establish sub-group memberships.</li>
  <li>Whatever method you use, it is best to create enough sub-groups to accommodate your entire roster, and make sure each group has at least one member who can log into Canvas for his group during class. It is not necessary to create a group leader.</li>
  <li>You can re-use group sets for additional reThinQ exercises, or create fresh groups as often as desired.</li>
 </ol>
</li>
  <li>Create a Quiz
  <ol><li>In the Canvas navigation menu, click the Quiz link. This should open even if the link appears gray. </li>
      <li>Click the blue +Quiz button.</li>
      <li>On the Quiz Settings tab:
 <ol class="show"><li>give your quiz a name</li>
       <li>if desired, check the shuffle answers checkbox</li>
       <li>Enter instructions. The quiz instructions will initially be hidden, but can be toggled into view. When visible, the instructions appear BESIDE rather than above the questions, and will remain visible as the question panel is scrolled.</li>
       <li> Other quiz settings are irrelevant unless you plan to deliver the Quiz outside of the reThinQ tool.
          </li>
  </ol></li>
  
  <li>Switch to the Questions tab, and create multiple choice questions. Any other question types you create within the quiz will be ignored within reThinQ.
        <ol class="show">
          <li>If you use Question Groups and choose to randomly select a subset of questions, these options will be respected by reThinQ.</li>
          <li>Be sure to add meaningful feedback to your answer options as appropriate. Your students will see this feedback immediately upon selecting an option.</li>
          <li>Set point values for questions as desired. The default value is one point per question. The value of each question is reduced by half each time an incorrect answer is selected. The points you assign per question will be reflected in the reThinQ scoring.</li>
          </ol>
      </li>
      <li>You do not need to publish the quiz. If you do publish it, be sure to set an appropriate release date to prevent students from viewing the questions prematurely.</li>
      </ol>
  </li><li>Create an Assignment
    
    <ol>
      <li>In the Canvas navigation menu, click the Assignments link. This should open even if the link appears gray. </li>
      <li>Click the blue +Assignment button.</li>
      <li>In the Create Assignments UI locate the Submission Type selector, and choose External Tool.</li>
      <li>Select the url field by clicking once inside it. A dialog window should appear.</li>
      <li>Locate the reThinQ tool and click it's name. A second dialog window will appear.</li>
      <li>Select a quiz and Group Set. </li>
      <li>Configure the remaining assignment options as desired.      </li>
      <li>Leave the instructions blank, or keep them very short. This allows maximum space for the Quiz instructions (which can be toggled) and the questions themselves.</li>
      <li>When you are ready, publish the assignment. Unpublished assignments will not be visible to students, even though as the instructor, you can see them.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Administer the reThinQ during class
    <ol>
      <li class="ui-state-error">Only ONE member of each team should begin a reThinQ assessment. Additional logins by any team member will be rejected and may cause confusion.</li>
      
    <li>Have <b>one</b> member of each team (Canvas group) log into Canvas and navigate to the appropriate assignment. </li>
    <li>Each group will have the opportunity to uncheck the names of group members who are absent.
      </li>
    <li>If necessary, re-organize student groups from within Canvas, and have any affected groups log out of reThinQ and then reload it by clicking it's link in the breadcrumbs, or refreshing their browser.</li>
    <li>Once any group has entered reThinQ, none of its group members will be permitted to restart the quiz in any way. </li>
    <li>Group scores will update each time a team selects an answer option. The assignment grade history can be viewed at any time to learn more about each team's performance.</li>
    <li class="ui-state-error">Warning: Students may receive excessive email, tweets or other notifications from Canvas if they have selected the ASAP setting for Grading with the 'include scores' box checked. They can turn down their personal Notification settings by clicking the 'Settings' link in the black zone of the Canvas header, and then clicking the 'Notifications' menu item. </li>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div class="faq"> <p class="instructions">Click on a question to reveal its answer</p>
<ul class="close-others">
<li>I created an assignment with a submission type of External Tool, and I can see it when I launch reThinQ, but my students can't see it. What's wrong?
  <ul><li>Be sure your assignment is published.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>What should I do if one or more students switch groups during class?
  <ul>
    <li>If the switch takes place before either team has started the quiz, log into Canvas and make the corresponding switch by visiting the People tool and editing the Group Set. Once the groups have been corrected, have the affected groups log out of reThinQ, and then reload it. </li>
    <li>If either team has already loaded reThinQ questions, make a paper note of the changes, and correct the scores manually after the reThinQ exercise has been completed.</li>
  </ul>
