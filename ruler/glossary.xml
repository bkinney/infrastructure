<dl><dt>Binary fractions</dt><dd>
Fractions which are created by repeated dividing increments in half. For example, if we start with a unit equaling 1 foot, you would first divide it into halves, then quarters, then eighths, etc.</dd>

<dl><dt>Decimalized fractions</dt><dd>
Fractions which are created by repeated dividing increments into ten parts. For example, if we start with a unit equaling 1 foot, you would first divide it into tenths, then hundredths, then thousandths, etc.</dd>

<dl><dt>Architect%27s scale</dt><dd>
A specialized ruler used to measure feet from a reduced scale drawing such as a blueprint. The ruler contains 11 different scales. Within each scale, feet are subdivided to facilitate measurement in inches, and binary fractions of an inch.</dd>

<dl><dt>Engineer%27s scale</dt><dd>
A specialized ruler divided into decimalized fractions of an inch.  Similar to an architect%27s scale, it is used to create or to measure distances from reduced scale drawings.  This six-sided ruler has one edge divided into tenths of an inch (marked 10), and the subsequent edges divided into twentieths (20), thirtieths (30), fortieths (40), fiftieths (50), and sixtieths (60) of an inch.</dd>
