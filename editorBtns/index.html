<p>These are all anonymous apps and should not require much maintenance. The only dependent file is /canvas/oembed/index.php, which is required for the jQuery Widgets. The custom&nbsp;css and js files for the UD&nbsp;account must also be in place.</p>

<p>Currently there is no online storage location for the most recent versions...I have them on my chromebit. When I decide where they should live, I will put the link here. It is a shame that Instructure changed the way custom code is stored. They make you upload rather than link it now, so it means that losing the files or version errors are now both likely scenarios as time goes by.&nbsp;</p>
